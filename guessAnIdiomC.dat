A DIME A DOZEN
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY
BEAT AROUND THE BUSH
BITE THE BULLET
BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
BITING OFF MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW
BEATING A DEAD HORSE
BY THE SKIN OF YOUR TEETH
CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH
FANCY PANTS
THE DROP OF A HAT
FIT AS A FIDDLE
MEET YOUR WATERLOO
COLD SHOULDER
WILD GOOSE CHASE
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
HEARD IT ON THE GRAPEVINE
OFF THE HOOK
COOK YOUR GOOSE
PIECE OF CAKE
THE HORSES MOUTH
COLD SHOULDER
A WINK IS AS GOOD AS A NOD
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
FIT AS A FIDDLE
DOWN IN FLAMES
SECOND WIND
OFF YOUR ROCKER
TWO PEAS IN A POD
TIME IS MONEY
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER
THICK AND THIN
NOSE OUT OF JOINT
HAPPY GO LUCKY
PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH
RAKING IT IN
CLEVER PANTS
OVER THE MOON
ONCE IN A BLUE MOON
HAPPY GO LUCKY
ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER
EASY DOES IT
CUTTING CORNERS
CALL IT A DAY
HIT THE SACK
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
NO PAIN NO GAIN
OFF THE HOOK
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL
UNDER THE WEATHER
MAKING MATTERS WORSE
THE LAST STRAW
SO FAR SO GOOD
BREAK A LEG
A BIRD IN THE HAND
A PERFECT STORM
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY
BIRDS OF A FEATHER
BREAK THE ICE
AN ARM AND A LEG
SKIN OF YOUR TEETH
CRYING OVER SPILT MILK
IGNORANCE IS BLISS
RAINING CATS AND DOGS
LOOK BEFORE YOU LEEP
ON THIN ICE
